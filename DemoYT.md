The game is set in a post-apocalyptic scenario where zombies are on the verge of eradicating all life on Earth. It is a concise game developed in the Godot 3 engine, utilizing 2D graphics. To assist in the creation and design of the game, I have employed several assets that are free from copyright restrictions, including user interface (UI) components, graphics, and animations.

The demo can be found on YouTube using the following link:
