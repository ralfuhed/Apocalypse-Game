### The game is about Apocalypse where the zombies are conquering the world and try to extinct every creature on earth. It's a short game that was built in Godot 3 2D. I used couple of assets that are free of copyrights to help me build this game and design it (e.g., UI, graphics, animations, etc.).

### The demo can be found on YouTube using the following link:
